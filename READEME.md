# Reflection
I liked the GUI for this assignment and learning how to create these interfaces as there can be many applications using this as a foundation. The syntax is something that is challenging for me when learning new things in Java, however there are many resources available and reminders for syntax conventions and through practice I can see myself becoming more familiar.
